# SympNet
A Modular Toolkit for Symptom-Based Disease Classification, Visualization, and Synthetic Data Generation
This is documentation of everything I learned through while building this project. 

Steps to Follow to Understand this project : 

- My Idea behind this project
- Choosing the dataset
- Visualising the dataset
- Architecture of the project
- Implementation

This documentation will include basic concepts that I went through to understand the engineering behind the concept. I will try to attach all the resources as well for better understanding of these concepts in detail. 

To understand the project in a wider prospectus we must understand classifiers first.
